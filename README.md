# Dots and Circles

## What is this?
Source code for Dots and Circles, a free game that's avaliable here:
https://momohoudai.itch.io/dots-and-circles

It a proof of concept of the first version of my engine that's written almost from scratch. The only libraries I use in this project are:
- OpenGL's API
- Win32 API
- STB Image

Since this project is mostly for my personal education, I do not seek collaborations and as such will not provide instructions on how to build the game. 
All the scripts to do so, however, can be found in this repository. 
Feel free to reference the code, fork it and do whatever.
